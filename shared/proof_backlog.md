# APW Proof Backlog – Voice & Agentic AI
This backlog is a list of small demos that show what APW can actually do.
The idea is to prove features in a practical way, not just talk about them.

Proof Items & Rationale

1. Inbound Voice Agent Demo
Why it’s proof:
Demonstrates baseline capability to handle inbound voice calls using an LLM-powered agent.

What it validates:
- End-to-end voice flow
- Telephony + LLM integration
- Basic conversational handling

2. Realtime Streaming + Barge-in
Why it’s proof: 
Validates low-latency interaction and user experience quality.

What it validates:
- Realtime audio streaming
- User interruption (barge-in)
- Latency-sensitive orchestration

3. Outbound AI Calling
Why it’s proof: 
Shows ability to automate proactive sales and follow-up calls.

What it validates:
- Outbound telephony
- Scripted + dynamic conversations
- Sales automation use cases
  
4. CRM Integration
Why it’s proof:  
Demonstrates enterprise readiness and system integration capability.

What it validates:
- CRM data access (HubSpot / Salesforce)
- Call logging and context retrieval
- Workflow integration

5. Analytics Dashboard
Why it’s proof: 
Provides observability into voice agent behavior and performance.

What it validates:
- Conversation transcripts
- Call metrics and analytics
- Debugging and QA workflows

6. Human Handoff
Why it’s proof: 
Ensures reliability when AI confidence is low or escalation is required.

What it validates:
- Seamless live transfer to human agents
- Hybrid AI + human workflows
- Production reliability

7. PII Redaction
Why it’s proof:  
Shows security and compliance considerations are built into the system.

What it validates:
- Sensitive data masking
- Consent enforcement
- Compliance-aligned workflows

8. Failure Handling
Why it’s proof:  
Demonstrates production-grade resilience under failure conditions.

What it validates:
- Retry mechanisms
- Fallback logic
- Graceful error handling
