# APW Proof Backlog – Voice & Agentic AI
This backlog is a list of small demos that show what APW can actually do.
The idea is to prove features in a practical way, not just talk about them.

1. Inbound voice agent demo using Twilio + LLM
(This demo shows that APW can receive incoming phone calls and respond using an AI model.
It proves basic call handling and AI conversation.)

2. Realtime streaming voice agent with barge-in support
(This demo shows that the agent can listen and speak at the same time.
Users can interrupt the agent while it is talking.)

3. Outbound AI calling demo (sales / follow-up use case)
(This demo shows the AI calling users automatically for sales or follow-ups.
The call flow is controlled by simple logic.)

4. CRM integration demo (HubSpot / Salesforce)
(This demo shows how the agent can read or update CRM data during a call.
For example, saving lead details or booking meetings.)

6. Conversation transcript + analytics dashboard
(This demo shows call transcripts, summaries, and basic metrics.
Calls can be reviewed after they end.)

7. Human handoff during live call
(This demo shows how a human agent can join or take over a call when needed.)

8. PII redaction and consent handling demo
(This demo shows how sensitive user data is hidden and consent is handled properly.
For example, masking phone numbers or credit card details.)

9. Failure handling demo (fallback + retry scenarios)
(This demo shows what happens when something goes wrong.
The system retries or switches to a fallback.)
