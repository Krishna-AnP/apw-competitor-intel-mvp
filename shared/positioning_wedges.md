# APW Positioning Wedges (Voice & Agentic AI)

## 1. Deep Observability by Default
APW provides end-to-end visibility across voice agents including transcripts, latency, tool calls, and failure paths. Most competitors expose only high-level dashboards.

## 2. Transparent & Modular Architecture
Unlike black-box platforms, APW builds modular systems where clients can inspect, extend, and swap components (LLMs, ASR, TTS, telephony).

## 3. Faster Customization & Deployment
APW optimizes for rapid proof-of-value with custom workflows, compared to rigid competitor templates.

## 4. Strong Human-in-the-Loop Controls
APW prioritizes safe human handoff, escalation, and override paths—critical for enterprise voice use cases.

## 5. Vendor & Model Flexibility
No lock-in to a single model or speech provider; APW supports best-fit choices per use case.

## 6. Security-First Delivery
PII redaction, consent handling, and auditability are built into the architecture rather than bolted on later.

## 7. Cost & Reliability Transparency
APW surfaces token, telephony, and infra costs clearly, enabling proactive cost controls and reliability tuning.
